## Appendix F: Large Example Function

This example shows several of the types of checks this library is designed to
assist with.  Suppose we have the following function:

<!--- gotomd::file::./large_example_function/example.go -->

we could test all of the expected outputs with the following test (with
passing and failing version)s

<!--- gotomd::file::./large_example_function/example_test.go -->

causing the following output when these tests are run:

<!--- gotomd::tst::./large_example_function/package -->

## Appendix G: Large Example Main Function

Given the following main.go file:

<!--- gotomd::file::./large_example_main_function/main.go -->

we can provide 100% test coverage with the following test file showing both
successful and failing responses:

<!--- gotomd::file::./large_example_main_function/main_test.go -->

<!--- gotomd::tst::./large_example_main_function/package -->
